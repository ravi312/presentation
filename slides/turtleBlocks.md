## Abstract

- design and and implementation of 
- how it supports core programming concepts 
- alignment with constructionist approach
- Online session
- Different styles used for problem solving


## Introduction
- Visual programming advantages over text-based ( Reopenning, 2017)
- Examples turtle blocks, scratch ( inspired by LOGO)
- popularly known as microworlds based on constructionist ideas
- > "a simplifies piece of reality which you can explore, and again there is no right or wrong" ( Papert, 1987)
- serveral affordances
	- "objects to think with"
	- tinkerability
	- allows different ways of knowing ( Resnick and Resenbaum, 2013)
	- metaphorically, "low, floor, wide walls and high ceilings"( ) 	
	- Noss and Hoyles, 2017
- suitable for engaging both experts and novices tp create personally meaningful artifacts
- Draf-drop gestures, color coded blocks -> command palette, snap like lego pieces
	- insert gif of polygons, spiral square..


## Research Design


## Research Questions
- How do we introduce learners to the mi
- objectives
	- introduce the learners to a visual programming language
	- to provide contexts for the learners to express their ideas and creations with others in the peer group
	- to foster computational thinking in the process 
- broader goal was to keep the engagement meaningful, accessible, personalized and universal. 

- Three weeks in the form of six online sessions
- IM -> present the ideas in the form of challenges for others 
- thematic challenges were given
- encouraged to share their creations with others
- learners submitted their projects along with a reflective questionnaire

The objective of the study was to explore 
- how the design of an online collaborative engagement influenced the teaching-learning processes in the context of a microworld.
- The main research question had two parts:
	- To understand the learning processes of the participants, and second was to identify which features of our designed engagement were beneficial in the constructionist framework of learning. 
- Detailed analysis of the engagement is not yet complete, but the insights gained so far provide us with some broad findings and ideas for the next iteration of the engagement.
- Share some vignettes from the engagement in the context of problem-solving, computational thinking and collaborative interactions.


## Contexts
- heterogeneous group of young people and adults 
- engagement 6 weeks
- synchornous online session and asynchornous instant messaging (IM)
